"""The draft Sales Order an M-Pesa STK push is sent from, until the cashier submits the sale.

The payment dialog used to make a draft Sales Invoice before every push and keep it for good
once a push went out, so every push the customer never paid left a POS-numbered invoice draft
behind. A push now names a draft Sales Order (`custom_klik_mpesa_order`). Submitting the sale
turns it into the invoice the way a held order checks out: klik's own submit builds the invoice
from the cart, the invoice records the order (`powerpack_source_order`), every push sent from
the order is pointed at the invoice, and the order is deleted.

The order is on the Held tab from the first push (`custom_is_klik_held`), so a push that may
still pay - or already has - is never left on an order nobody can see, whatever becomes of
the checkout that sent it. Leaving checkout deletes it unless such a push exists; then it
stays held, to be finished from the Held tab.
